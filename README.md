A Slot Machine Simulation

<u>Understand the Application</u>

<strong>What it Looks Like to the User</strong>

The program will loop, asking the user for a bet amount from 0 to 50 (assume dollars, you can use <strong>ints</strong> or <strong>longs</strong>).  If the user types a 0 that means she wants to quit.  Otherwise, accept the amount as their bet and simulate a <strong><em>slot machine pull</em></strong>.  Your program will print out a line that looks like a slot machine result containing three strings.  Some examples are:<strong>  <u>BAR  7  BAR</u></strong><strong><u>,</u></strong><strong> <u>7  7  cherries</u>, <u>cherries  BAR  space</u>, <u>space  BAR  BAR</u>, or <u>cherries  cherries  BAR</u></strong>.

<ul>

 <li>Each of the three positions in the string could be one of the following:  “<strong>BAR</strong>“, “<strong>7</strong>“, “<strong>cherries</strong>” or “<strong>space</strong>“.</li>

 <li>Each of the three output positions must be generated by your program randomly with probabilities (defined, as always, by <strong>final statics</strong>):

  <ul>

   <li><strong>BAR</strong> (38%)</li>

   <li><strong>cherries</strong> (40%)</li>

   <li><strong><u>space</u></strong>    (7%)</li>

   <li><strong><u>7</u></strong>     (15%)</li>

   <li>Therefore, <strong>cherries</strong> should be the most frequent symbol seen and <strong>space</strong> or <strong><u>7</u></strong>the least frequent.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>The following combinations should pay the bet as shown (note <strong><em>ORDER MATTERS</em></strong>):

  <ul>

   <li><strong>cherries  [not cherries]  [any]</strong>pays <strong>5</strong> × <strong>bet</strong> (5 <strong><em>times</em></strong> the bet)</li>

   <li><strong>cherries  cherries  [not cherries]</strong>pays <strong>15</strong> × <strong>bet</strong></li>

   <li><strong>cherries  cherries  cherries</strong>pays <strong>30</strong> × <strong>bet</strong></li>

   <li><strong>BAR  BAR  BAR </strong>pays <strong>50</strong>× <strong>bet</strong></li>

   <li><strong>7  7  7</strong>pays <strong>100</strong> × <strong>bet</strong></li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>After the pull, display the three strings regardless of the outcome.  If the user did not win, tell him/her “Sorry, you lose.”  If he won, pay him by displaying his winnings (his original bet <strong><em>times</em></strong>the winning factor from the above table).  Then, repeat the whole process by requesting another bet amount.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Position counts!</strong> If you read the above bullet that contains the warning “ORDER MATTERS”, you will see that <strong><u>cherries bar cherries</u></strong> pays 5× while <strong><u>cherries cherries bar</u></strong> pays 15× and <strong><u>bar cherries cherries</u></strong> pays nothing.

<strong>A Helper Class:  TripleString</strong>

For this assignment we use our previous  class <strong>TripleString</strong>. You can use your version, with corrections based on my feedback, or my instructor solution.  Either way, be sure that it is corrected before incorporating here.   I. e., if my instructor solution has any mistakes, you must fix them before using the class here — I don’t think it does, but it might.   We will instantiate <strong>TripleString</strong> objects that can be used in our <strong>main() </strong>method and/or the static methods that <strong>main()</strong> invokes to simulate this casino project.

<strong>The Static Foothill Methods</strong>

Each static <strong>Foothill</strong> method that you have to write to simulate this casino app plays a special role.  For example, there will be one method that gets the bet from the user and returns it to <strong>main()</strong>:

public static int <strong>getBet()</strong>

Another method will simulate a random pull of the slot machine — it generates three random strings and returns them as a <strong>TripleString</strong> object to <strong>main()</strong>:

public static <strong>TripleString pull()</strong>

An output method will be used at the end of each loop-pass when the user needs to see the results of her pull, and receive the news about how much she won (or not):

public static void display <strong>(TripleString thePull, int winnings )</strong>

We will describe each method — and a few others — in the next section.

<u>The Program Spec</u>

<strong>The Foothill Static Method Specs</strong>

int getBet()

This prompts the user for input and returns the bet amount as a functional return.  It should vet the amount before it returns and insist on a legal bet (0 <u>&lt;</u> <strong>bet</strong> <u>&lt;</u> 50)<em> until it gets one from the user</em>.  This method loops.  If any other method is used to test for an illegal value or output an error message based on an illegal value, there will be a 4 point penalty.  <strong>getBet()</strong> must return the legal value to the client and not take any other action besides getting the legal amount.

<strong>getBet()</strong> has to not only <strong><em>acquire</em></strong> the bet from the user, but also do the output that <strong><em>asks</em></strong> for the bet.

This method must not end the program, but return the valid input result, 0, to the client if/when the user provides it.  The client, <strong>main()</strong> will do what it must when it sees a return value of 0 from this method.

TripleString pull()

This method instantiates and returns a <strong>TripleString</strong> object to the client.   The data of the <strong>TripleString</strong> object has to first be filled with three randomly chosen strings according to the probabilities described in the “Understand the Application” section above. For example, it might return a <strong>TripleString</strong> object that contains the three strings <strong>[“cherries”,  “BAR” , “space”]</strong>.

The way it determines and loads the three strings is by using a private <strong><em>helper method</em></strong>, described, next, <strong>randString()</strong>.  So this method, <strong>pull()</strong> will call the next method <strong>randString()</strong> three times to get the three strings that will be stored into the <strong>TripleString</strong> object.  Once that’s done, <strong>pull()</strong> just returns the <strong>TripleString</strong> object to the client and its job is done.

String randString()

This <strong>private</strong> helper method does a little work — yet is still quite short.  It produces and returns a single random string based on the required probabilities.  It does this by calling the java <strong>Math.random()</strong> function and using the return result of that function as a means of deciding which of the four possible strings to return.  Take this in stages.  <strong>Math.random()</strong> returns a double between 0 and 1.  One idea (but not the only one) is to turn that <strong>double</strong> into an <strong>int</strong>  between 1 and 1000 using techniques from five weeks ago.  Then, decide which of those numbers should trigger a “7”, which should trigger a “cherries”, etc. based on the desired probabilities.  Since a “Bar” should happen 38% the time, which numbers would you want to trigger a “Bar”?  Since a “cherries” should happen 40% of the time, which numbers would trigger a “cherries”?  So you see, this is a very simple — and even short — function, even though it has to be designed carefully.  Common sense will go a long way here.

Although this is the only method the requires the constant (finals) that determine the probabilities, those probabilities should be declared as <strong>Foothill static</strong> finals  for easy reference and future changes.

int getPayMultiplier (TripleString thePull)

After <strong>main()</strong> gets a <strong>TripleString</strong> object from <strong>pull()</strong>, which we will call <strong>pullString</strong>, it needs to know what the payout will be.  That’s the job of this function.  <strong>getPayMultiplier()</strong> takes the <strong>pullString </strong>as a parameter, and inspects it to determine what its pay multiplier should be:  5?  15?  100?  0?   It does this by looking at the three strings inside the passed-in <strong>TripleString</strong> object and using <em>if statements</em> to determine and return the right value.  For example, if all three of the strings are “cherries”, which is easily checked using an<em> if statement</em>, then this method returns a pay multiplier of 30.  You can use logic like this to create a sequence of <em>if</em> or <em>else if</em>statements that will give you the desired multiplier.   However you do it, the method will return one of the values;  0, 5, 15, 30, 50 or 100.

void display (TripleString thePull, int winnings )

This method takes the winnings (a dollar amount) and <strong>thePull</strong> as parameters and displays the three strings inside <strong>thePull</strong> along with “sorry – you lost ” or “congrats, you won $X.”

Where it All Goes

You can create the <strong>TripleString</strong> class as a non-public class directly in your client <strong>Foothill.java</strong> file. You type it directly into that file;<em> do not ask Eclipse to create a new class for you or it will generate a second .java file which we don’t want right now.</em> In other words, <strong>Foothill.java</strong> will look like this:

import java.util.*;

import java.lang.Math;




public class Foothill

{

// main class stuff …

}




class TripleString

{

// TripleString class stuff …

}

As you see, <strong>TripleString</strong> is to be defined <strong><em>after</em></strong>, not <em>within</em>, the <strong>Foothill</strong> class definition. This makes it a sibling class, capable of being used by any other classes in the file  (of which there happens to be only one: <strong>Foothill</strong>).

main()’s Workflow

You can debug each of the above methods individually using a<strong><em> test main()</em></strong> that consists of a statement or two.  That way you will make sure each component works before trying to write the final <strong>main()</strong> client.

<strong>main()</strong> will be a loop controlled by value returned from <strong>getBet()</strong>.  As long as that value is non-zero, we keep playing.

Each time through the loop, we have to call <strong>pull()</strong> to get the <strong>pullString</strong> as a return value. Then we need to pass that to <strong>getPayMultiplier()</strong> to find the multiplier.  We then compute the winnings based on the previous information, and finally we display it all using <strong>display()</strong>.  That’s all that each loop pass does.  So <strong>main() </strong>is quite neat and clean.

<strong>Input Errors</strong>

The only place the user can make an input error is in <strong>getBet()</strong>, so that’s the method that deals with such errors.  Don’t worry about non-numbers.  Assume that an <strong>integer</strong>was entered.  But do test for range and only return to <strong><em>main</em></strong> after you have a number in the valid range. <strong>getBet()</strong> may not decide about ending the program.  That’s up to <strong>main()</strong>.

<strong>Test Run Requirements</strong>:

Submit one run that lasts a<strong><em> minimum of 40 pulls</em></strong>, but possibly more (continue reading).   At least once enter an illegal amount to make sure that your program handles it correctly.  <strong>Also, make sure your one run contains <em><u>both</u></em> a win of </strong><strong>cherries  cherries  cherries</strong><strong>  <em>and</em> a win of  </strong><strong>BAR  BAR  BAR</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>This may take many runs, but should be accomplished in less than two minutes if your program is written correctly.

<strong>General Requirements</strong>

Communicate all values as <strong><em>parameters</em></strong> or <strong><em>return values</em></strong>, not through <strong><em>globals</em></strong> (static class variables). The meaning of these terms and examples are contained in the module reading.

Again, <strong>getBet()</strong> must not only <strong><em>acquire</em></strong> the bet from the user, but also do the output that <strong><em>asks</em></strong> for the bet.

Between your source and your run, report which pull groups that resulted in <strong><em>all cherries</em></strong> and which pulls resulted in<strong><em> all BAR</em></strong>s (e.g., “pull groups #33 and #5 resulted in all cherries and pull group #62 resulted in all BARs.”  You can type this out in your text file manually after you have pasted the source and run in their correct places.

Also, I will emphasize that in keeping with the separation of I/O and computation, we would not have any method other than <strong>display()</strong> output results to the screen, and <strong>display()</strong> is called from <strong>main()</strong>, not from any other method. Similarly, <strong>getBet()</strong> is the only method that does input.  The other methods do no input, no output and do not call any methods that do input or output.  Let’s keep that idea fresh.

Sample Output

Here is an example of a partial run sample (although some numbers and details are not based on the exact requirements, above, and would therefore not receive credit):

// ***  I got a pull of all BARS in pull 1 and all cherries in pull 46 ***
